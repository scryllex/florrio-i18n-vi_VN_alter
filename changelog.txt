	- Poison from different players against the same mob now stack.

January 4th 2024

	- Higher tier mobs now have varying amounts of slow resistance.

December 30th 2022
	- Drops are now shared among the 4 players that dealt the most damage to the mob (as long as they deal at least 5% damage). Squad damage is counted together. Only flowers within about a screen distance can get drops from a mob.

	- As a special event, we'll be running a game mode that some of you might feel some familiarity with. Have fun!
	- Some summoner petals are disabled in the main map of this mode (still useable inside antholes). Unfortunately this is too abuseable.

December 28th 2022
	- We're experimenting with a HUGE rebalancing of the entire game. We've reset everyone's waves for this. Please be patient while we tweak things to get everything perfect
	- The idea is increasing the gap between rarities. Such that if you have unusual petals, a rare mob actually presents a bigger challenge. Before this update, there wasn't really enough distinction between lower mob rarities.

December 26th 2022

	- Added damage numbers, toggleable in the settings (default on).

November 30th 2022
	- Mobile users can now tap and hold a petal on the crafting screen to add many at a time.
	- To make the game a little bit easier, petals now move towards enemies within a certain range of them, which should make it easier to hit enemies.
	- Since many people have spent their TP without realizing how permanent they are, we will be doing a future update (in late December) in which players can reset their TP allocation once per year.
	- As a reminder, we'll be adding more things to spend TP on as time goes on.

November 29th 2022
	- The long awaited talents update is here.
	- Killing mobs no longer awards XP. We have reset everyone's levels back to 1 as this update significantly changes how levels are acquired.
	- Petals can now be absorbed to earn XP.
	- Advancing levels provides TP, which can be used to upgrade talents.
	- talents have a permanent effect on your flower. Once upgraded they're unlocked forever. There is no way to undo TP spent on talents.

	- Level cap has been raised to 200.

November 15th 2022
	- Nerfed Hornet health.

November 6th 2022
	- Tweaked number of mobs in each wave.
	- Tweaked map size in later waves.
	- We're trying to incentivize clearing mobs before the wave ends by making all mobs aggro when it ends. The map size changes also makes it harder to stay in one spot and just tank all mobs.
	- We've reset the highest wave beaten by everyone to wave 25, if it was previously higher than that. This is due to the change in wave difficulty.
	- Enemies no longer have their attack range the same as their aggro range (so hornets for example won't start attacking from half way across the map).

November 4th 2022
	- Map now scales based on the mobs contained within, this should avoid crowding out in late game waves.
	- Recipe for Ultra petals has changed.
	  Now creates 50 Ultras from 5 Mythics.

	  Now creates 3 Ultras from 1 Mythic.
	  No longer reverts back to Mythic on use, it's just lost forever.
	  Unused Ultras before this update have been converted back to 2 Mythics (old recipe).

November 2nd 2022
	- Added Ultra petals.
	  You can combine 2 Mythics to form an Ultra.
	  Ultra petals are several times stronger than Mythics, but only last for one match.
	  After one match, they will revert back to 1 Mythic (the other is lost).

October 20th 2022
	- Pseudo-RNG system has been removed from crafting. Now it's back to truly random with no increasing odds. If you have any failed attempts on a specific petal, it'll keep using the old system until you succeed (so you don't lose increased odds you already accumulated).

October 11th 2022
	- Added Apple ID login. Note that it doesn't merge Apple ID accounts with Discord accounts. If you already logged in using Discord, keep using that to login. This addition is intended to make it easier for those that don't have a Discord account to keep their progress.

August 5th 2022
